# Computational_Learning_HW
Repository for the homework on Computational Learning from course Computational Learning and Deep Learning.

Individual work on MIMIC Database, provided in a limited form by the professor to provide a better working environment regarding the scope of the project.
Project specifically focused on working and optimizing both KNN and SVC models for HOSPITAL_EXPIRE_FLAG, no other models were to be considered for this specific project.

Tailored the project to suit a Kaggle competition format (with people from within the class only), which I got really good results in and even came up first regarding SVC classification.
